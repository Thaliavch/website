    <br>
    <p> Welcome! My name is Thalia Valle Chavez. Iâ€™m in my junior year at Florida Gulf Coast University,
      studying Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I'm genuinely passionate about learning and solving problems, 
      which drew me to this field. I'm particularly interested in its potential to drive innovation. I consider myself a learner 
      at heart and consistently work towards improving professionally and personally. I am well-versed in topics such as
      object-oriented programming and data structures, and I have experience in programming languages such as HTML, JavaScript,
      Python and C++. On campus, I've been given the opportunity to serve as Vice-President for the 
      Software Engineering Club and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers - roles I cherish as they allow me to connect 
      with peers and continue my growth journey.
