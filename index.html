    <br>
    <p> Welcome! My name is Thalia Valle Chavez. Iâ€™m in my junior year at Florida Gulf Coast University, studying Software Engineering witha minor 
      in Mathematics. I'm genuinely passionate about learning and solving problems, which drew me to this field. I'm particularly interested in its
      potential to drive innovation. I consider myself a learner at heart and consistently work towards improving professionally and personally.
      I am well-versed in topics such as object-oriented programming and data structures, and I have experience in programming languages such as HTML, 
      JavaScript, Python, and C++. On campus, I've been given the opportunity to serve as Vice-President of the Software Engineering Club and the Society
      of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
