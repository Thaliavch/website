      <br>
      <p>I am from Cuba! and came to the United States four years ago. Coming here, I never planned to study software engineering but life led me this way. 
         A few months after I arrived, I was hired in a cellphone repair shop, where I started working as a store associate and ended up as a repair technician. 
         While there, I fell in love with the world of technology, and my growing curiosity about how "things worked" took me to the internet, where I found myself learning to program.
         Ultimately I decided to pursue a degree in Software Engineering or Computer Science.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Back in Cuba I finished a career in music performance and pedagogy. I love music, and arts in general.
      I also enjoy being surrounded by nature. I love mountains and rivers specially, but also like to spend time
         near the sea</p>
